# Contributing Guide

First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰  
This project grows stronger through community involvement, and we welcome ideas, improvements, and fixes.

---

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
- Make sure the bug or feature request hasnâ€™t already been reported.
- Provide as much detail as possible (steps to reproduce, environment, expected vs actual results).
- Be respectful when raising issues. Remember there are real people behind the code.

### Submitting Pull Requests
- Fork the repository and create your feature branch from `main`.
- Keep changes focused. One pull request per feature/fix.
- Run tests locally to ensure nothing is broken.
- Update documentation (README, examples, comments) where appropriate.
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages.

---

## Code Style & Quality
- Follow [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) coding standards.  
  You can use **PHP CodeSniffer** or similar tools to check compliance.
- Write tests for new functionality (we use [Orchestra Testbench](https://github.com/orchestral/testbench) for Laravel packages).
- Keep pull request history clean. Squash commits if necessary.

---

## Feature Requests
Before suggesting a new feature:
- Ask yourself if it would be useful to the wider community, not just your project.
- Check if itâ€™s already in progress or proposed in open issues/PRs.

---

## Release Philosophy
- We follow [Semantic Versioning (SemVer 2.0.0)](https://semver.org/).
- Breaking changes must be avoided unless explicitly planned for a major release.

---

## Community Etiquette
- Be constructive, kind, and professional in all interactions.
- Respect the maintainersâ€™ time and decisions. Not every idea can be merged.
- Collaboration is more valuable than confrontation.
